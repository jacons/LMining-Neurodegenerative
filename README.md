# Literature Mining for Neurodegenerative disease

This study aims to develop an automated pipeline that includes various algorithms to retrieve information, analyze a Knowledge graph, and discover new pathways in the medical domain. The pipeline incorporates algorithms such as BERN, PageRank and Dijkstra. Throughout the article, we delve into the retrieval of relevant documents, the processing of gathered information to acquire knowledge, the discovery or consolidation of existing pathways and finally assess the result with a benchmark database.
